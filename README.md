# 3D-Scene

How do I approach designing software?
I design software development by workoing on specific requirements and aspects of a large project. I also use Agile principles to work on specific aspects of an application as well. 
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
My design skills helped me craft a 3D scene and world with openGL and C++.
What design process did you follow for your project work?
The design process of working on specific aspects of the 3D scene each week so that I can build to a fully functional scene. 
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
My tactics from my design approach can be applied to the future as I am able to tests functionality of applications and work on fixing bugs and ensuring the application still works as intended when changes are made.
How do I approach developing programs?
I approach developing programs by ensuring I have user needs at the fore front of designing the application. 
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
New development strategies I used when working on my 3D scene included having artifacts to focus on during weekly sprints. 
How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration factored into my development as each sprint I iterated and refined my 3D scene adding textures and additional objects in the scene. 
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
My approach to developing code throughout the project and milestones by focusing on adding higher quality code instead of adding as many things into the scene and project, making sure the scene of was the highest quality and functionality. 
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer Science can help me reach my goals by learning that iteration and working on projects requires several iteration and to face challenges and failures head on as when code doesn't work there's nothing wrong with that its just another step toward creating a high quality application that runs successfully. 
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Computer graphics and visualization gives me knowledge of making sure I test often when making changes in applications as computer graphics will tell you right away if you need to make new changes or roll back changes. 
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Computer graphics and visualization gives me new knowledge and skills that can be applied in my future professional path as I learned how to add movement and a camera to a 3D scene and ensured that I new how to make documentation and comments wherever I'm making changes.
